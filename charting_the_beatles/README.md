## CHARTING THE BEATLES

You've worked by yourself, collaborated with each other on labs and homeworks, we've pair programmed, we've worked in groups to explore a more realistic scenario of on-the-job experience.  For your final project, it's all up to you.  As always, the type of app you create is your choice: utility, social network, game, mashup, data visualization, etc. but be sure the scope is not too large so you can reasonably complete an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) by the deadline.

The objective of this project is to:

* Create a project from the ground up.
* Be organized and demonstrate clear thought.
* Write beautiful code
	* Cleanly and consitently formatted
	* Clearly thought out
	* Efficient (limited loops w/in loops)
* Pay attention to user experience
* Practice integrating topics covered during this entire course.

You can work alone or in groups no larger than 3 for this final project. Show us what you can do!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Test-driven** Use TDD as you are developing your app.  At a minimum, you should have 80% test coverage.
* **Handles Invalid Data.** Forms in your application should validate data on both the client-side with JavaScript and again on the back-end with rails.  Use regular expressions!  Ensure the user has entered the correct data types, string lengths, formats, etc.
* **Hosted.** Deploy your code to Heroku, and if using a database, PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
* **Rails 4 + (Backbone and/or D3)**  Take advantage of Rails 4 and Backbone and/or D3.  

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.  Pen and paper is very easy and you can take a picture to save it, or use software like PowerPoint, Keynote, Gliffy (online), and Omnigraffle ($$).
* **Wireframes.** Recall our first day and the "about you" table drawings…  Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Protoshare or Balsamic.
* **Resources.** Gather the necessary resources and bookmark links to any documentation or references you will be using in your project.  Add them to your documentation in a section called "Resources."
* **Milestones.** We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work, as they fit into our class milestones.
* **`README.md`** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project.  Explain your concept and data model.  What problem are you solving?  What gems and/or APIs are you using?
  * This needs a how and why of what they wanted to solve, how they built, problems, tech used.
  * This file should include the elements of your project plan.
  * Add your list of resources, research, and documentation links to this file.
  * If you're including a separate file or folder for your data model, put it in a file or folder called `data_model` with the proper extensions.
  * If you're including a separate file or folder for your wireframes, put it in a file or folder called `wireframe` with the proper extensions.

####Completed Project deliverables:

In addition to your `README.md` file with the project plan in your OWN repository on GitHub, add the following to your folder in the work repository under your name folder for week 12:

* Link to hosted project URL
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

In the morning when you walk into class:

* Thursday - Project plan deliverables due including a project backlog
* Friday - Data model complete and hosted on Heroku; Project should also be hosted in a new repository under your own account on GitHub.
	* **Name of project established**
* Monday - Core functionality nearing completion (back-end rails stuff, api connectivity established and functional, etc.), front-end underway
* Tuesday - Core functionality complete, working on UX enhancements.
* Wednesday - Completed project deliverables due.  Prepare presentation and succinct explanation of project, concepts, and defense of decisions.

End of the week:

* Wednesday day - In-class demos
* Wednesday night - Retrospective.  What worked well?  Where could my project be improved?  How could my process be improved?
* Wednesday day - Science fair
* For the rest of the week/weekend - WDI is over.  Clean up your final project code!

## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* In the proper places. Any business logic in views? Fat controllers?
* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your controllers, models, etc?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Write efficient code.
* Adheres to the code formatting styles we've been presenting in class.

We’ll also be looking at:

* User experience.  Can't emphasize this enough.  You have the power.
* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

###And most importantly...
**Work on something you** ***like*** and
#Have fun!
